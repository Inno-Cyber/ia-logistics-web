# IAL Website (React + Vite)

This is a ready-to-run React project for Innovation Aerospace Logistics (IAL).

## How to use
1. **Unzip** this folder.
2. Put your images into the `public` folder:
   - `logo.png` (your company logo)
   - `home-bg.jpg` (homepage background) â€” you can also use .png
3. Open a terminal **in this folder** and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

### Notes
- If your files are named differently, either rename them to `logo.png` and `home-bg.jpg`, or change the `src` paths in `src/App.jsx`.
- Tailwind CSS is loaded via CDN for simplicity. For production, you can switch to a full Tailwind build setup later.
